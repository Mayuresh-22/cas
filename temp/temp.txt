This basic implementation demonstrates the fundamental principles: identical content will always produce the same hash, and different content will always produce different hashes; the store automatically deduplicates content without any explicit logic.

We now realize some problems of in-memory storage, such as limited space, since a typical computer has around 16-32GB of RAM, and we would expect far more space in a real-world application for a storage service, and we will lose all data when the power is off.

Another problem with the current in-memory storage is that if we have 2 instances of the SimpleStore running in 2 different processes, then storing the same content in one process doesn’t necessarily prevent this same content get stored again in another process, since in modern operating system, each process has its own protected memory space — it prevents one program from accessing or corrupting another program’s memory:
